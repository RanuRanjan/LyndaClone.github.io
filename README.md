# Team management and working together:

As we assigned the project on 20th j uly 2021 and also we have got the name of our team
members. On the 20th j uly we talked with each other about the project and j oined a
meeting together i n which we explored the original website, understood the building
architecture of the website and the website working flow. After doing these things we made
our plan i n what flow we have to complete this and also decided a deadline from our side.
Deciding the deadline helped a l ot to build this website clone on time.

# Work division and working together:

We four people were i n a team. So after exploring the website and their flow we talked
about who i s good i n what technology. “ Knowing the strengths of team members helps to
complete the task efficiently and i n the given timeline.” We decided and divided the task
between us and we started the work right after meeting. I took two days to complete the
task from my side. And everyone did their work on time and also before the decided time.
It was our i nitial work that we did i n j ust two days. Then we decided to add some more
pages to our website and some more functionality. Ankit worked very well on functionality
of j s and also he did help me when I faced i ssues i n designing. All the team members were
very helpful. Pranali was an awesome team member. She spent the whole day working on
one thing to make i t perfect. Ranu always comes up with i deas l ike can we do this way or
2
that way. Ankit was silent and very dedicated. He did work very efficiently and also merged
our project.
